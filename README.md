# Staircase-Problem
How many ways can one climb a set of stairs of any length by taking step options from any number of options?

I came across this problem on YouTube and found it very interesting.

This can be solved quite simply and elegantly using recursion.  However, this solution has complexity of factorial growth. (fairly certain it is factorial growth … I may make a post about it on cramerexplainsmath.com … maybe!)

A much faster way to solve this is by using some maths, multinomial combinations should do the trick.
